//! One agent, opened: the detail read and the edit behind `GET`/`PATCH
//! {scope}/team/{agent_id}` (issue #264).
//!
//! Before this, an agent was a dead end. `GET …/team` returned a name, a role
//! and a description; nothing carried the agent's tier, its tool grants or its
//! desks, and there was no per-agent route at all. So the console could show a
//! card and offer to delete it, and that was the whole of what an operator
//! could learn or do. Worse than the missing screen: **checking what tools a
//! company actually grants an agent had no read surface anywhere**, which is
//! why a tool-grant change could not be verified from outside the process.
//!
//! ## Effective, not declared
//!
//! [`AgentToolsDto`] carries three lists rather than one, because the
//! interesting number is the one nobody could see. `requested` is what the
//! `[[agent]].tools` line asks for, `companyAllow` is the `[tools].allow`
//! ceiling it is intersected with, and `effective` is what the agent actually
//! ends up holding. An agent that requests `workspace.read` under a company
//! that allows only `composio` requests one tool and holds none, and a surface
//! that printed the request alone would report the opposite of the truth.
//!
//! `effective` is computed by
//! [`agent_effective_grants`](crate::runtime::builder::agent_effective_grants)
//! — the *same* function the harness calls when it builds the agent, not a
//! re-implementation of the rule. A second copy would eventually disagree, and
//! a tool-grant readout that disagrees with the harness is worse than none.
//!
//! ## What may be edited, and why that is the line
//!
//! The console edits what the console owns.
//!
//! An **overlay** teammate — one an operator defined through "Define an agent",
//! or the orchestrator created with `add_agent` — lives on the
//! [`CompanyRecord`], which this process writes. Its name, role and description
//! are editable here, and that is the whole of #264's "the roster is write-once
//! per member" complaint: before this, iterating on an agent's instructions
//! meant deleting it and starting over.
//!
//! A **manifest** teammate is declared in the version-controlled `company.toml`
//! and is not editable from a browser. This is the same line
//! [`MANIFEST_TEAMMATE_DELETE`](super::language::MANIFEST_TEAMMATE_DELETE)
//! already draws for removal, and it is drawn in the same place for the same
//! reason: the manifest is the company's blueprint, the overlay model exists so
//! the runtime never rewrites it, and a console PATCH that edited it would make
//! the deployed company silently diverge from the file in git.
//!
//! The one field that *is* editable on a manifest teammate — its daily budget —
//! is editable precisely because #343 modelled it as a
//! [`BudgetOverride`](crate::ports::types::BudgetOverride) layered on top rather
//! than as a rewrite. It keeps its own route and is untouched here.
//!
//! `tier` and `tools` are read-only for **both** kinds. There is no override
//! layer for either, and inventing one is a policy decision (an operator
//! raising an agent's own tool grants from a browser is a privilege question,
//! not a form field), not something to smuggle into a detail view.
//!
//! The server states the rule rather than leaving the console to re-derive it:
//! every detail response carries an [`editable`](AgentDetailDto::editable) list,
//! and the console renders a field read-only exactly when the host says it is.
//! A console that decided this for itself would drift from what the host
//! actually accepts, and the operator would meet the disagreement as a failed
//! save.
